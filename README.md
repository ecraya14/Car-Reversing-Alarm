# carReversingAlarm

**************************** SYSTEM DESCRIPTION *********************************

A button is used to arm the system and then disarm it. 
In a car, this is done when the reverse gear is engaged.
When it is engaged, the system gives an audible confirmation that it is working.
When an object is detected, an audible tone is generated and 
becomes increasingly noticeable, as the object gets closer.

This system is intended to work on KL25Z microcontroller.
